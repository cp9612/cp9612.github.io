If you missed the train I'm on<br>
You will know that I am gone<br>
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles<br>
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,<br>
A hundred miles, a hundred miles<br>
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles<br>
Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two,<br>
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four<br>
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home<br>
